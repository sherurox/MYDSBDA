1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic' as used in the above problem. Plot a box plot for distribution
of age with respect to each gender along with the information about whether they survived
or not. (Column names : 'sex' and 'age')
2. Write observations on the inference from the above statistics

# Downloading the Seaborn Library
# The seaborn library can be downloaded in a couple of ways. If you are using pip installer for Python libraries, you can
# execute the following command to download the library:
# pip install seaborn
# Alternatively, if you are using the Anaconda distribution of Python, you can use execute the following command to
# download the seaborn library:
# conda install seaborn

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

dataset = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
dataset.head()

# The dataset contains 891 rows and 15 columns and contains information about the passengers who boarded the unfortunate
# Titanic ship. The original task is to predict whether or not the passenger survived depending upon different features such as
# their age, ticket, cabin they boarded, the class of the ticket, etc. We will use the Seaborn library to see if we can find any
# patterns in the data

dataset.shape

dataset.isnull().sum()

# remove all null values from the dataset
dataset = dataset.dropna()

# The Joint Plot
# The jointplot()is used to display the mutual distribution of each column. You need to pass three parameters to jointplot. The
# first parameter is the column name for which you want to display the distribution of data on x-axis. The second parameter is
# the column name for which you want to display the distribution of data on y-axis. Finally, the third parameter is the name of
# the data frame.
# Let's plot a joint plot of age and fare columns to see if we can find any relationship between the two.
sns.jointplot(x='age', y='fare', data=dataset)

# From the output, you can see that a joint plot has three parts. A distribution plot at the top for the column on the x-axis, a
# distribution plot on the right for the column on the y-axis and a scatter plot in between that shows the mutual distribution of
# data for both the columns. You can see that there is no correlation observed between prices and the fares.
# You can change the type of the joint plot by passing a value for the kind parameter. For instance, if instead of scatter plot, you
# want to display the distribution of data in the form of a hexagonal plot, you can pass the value hex for the kind parameter.


sns.jointplot(x='age', y='fare', data=dataset, kind='hex')

# In the hexagonal plot, the hexagon with most number of points gets darker color. So if you look at the above plot, you can
# see that most of the passengers are between age 20 and 30 and most of them paid between 10-50 for the tickets.

# Categorical Plots
# Categorical plots, as the name suggests are normally used to plot categorical data. The categorical plots plot the values in the
# categorical column against another categorical column or a numeric column. Let's see some of the most commonly used
# categorical data.

# The Bar Plot
# The barplot() is used to display the mean value for each value in a categorical column, against a numeric column. The first
# parameter is the categorical column, the second parameter is the numeric column while the third parameter is the dataset.

# to know the mean value of the age of the male and female passengers, you can use the bar plot
sns.barplot(x='sex', y='age', data=dataset)

# you can clearly see that the average age of male passengers is just less than 40 while the average age of female passengers is
# around 33.
# to finding the average, the bar plot can also be used to calculate other aggregate values for each category. To do so, you
# need to pass the aggregate function to the estimator. 

# # To calculate the standard deviation for the age of each gender
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.barplot(x='sex', y='age', data=dataset, estimator=np.std)
# we use the std aggregate function from the numpy library to calculate the standard deviation for the ages of m

# Box Plot
# The box plot is used to display the distribution of the categorical data in the form of quartiles. The center of the box shows
# the median value. The value from the lower whisker to the bottom of the box shows the first quartile. From the bottom of the
# box to the middle of the box lies the second quartile. From the middle of the box to the top of the box lies the third quartile
# and finally from the top of the box to the top whisker lies the last quartile.

# let's plot a box plot that displays the distribution for the age with respect to each gender. You need to pas
sns.boxplot(x='sex', y='age', data=dataset)


# Let's try to understand the box plot for female. The first quartile starts at around 5 and ends at 22 which means that 25% of
# the passengers are aged between 5 and 25. The second quartile starts at around 23 and ends at around 32 which means that
# 25% of the passengers are aged between 23 and 32. Similarly, the third quartile starts and ends between 34 and 42, hence
# 25% passengers are aged within this range and finally the fourth or last quartile starts at 43 and ends around 65.
# If there are any outliers or the passengers that do not belong to any of the quartiles, they are called outliers and are
# represented by dots on the box plot.
# if you want to see the box plots of forage of passengers of both genders, along with the information about wh
sns.boxplot(x='sex', y='age', data=dataset, hue="survived")

# If we want to see the box plots of forage of passengers of both genders,
#  along with the information about whether or not they survived, we can pass
#   the survived as value to the hue parameter.

# We can also see the distribution of the passengers who survived. For instance,
#  we can see that among the male passengers, on average more younger people survived as
#   compared to the older ones. Similarly, we can see that the variation among the age of
#    female passengers who did not survive is much greater than the age of the surviving female passengers
